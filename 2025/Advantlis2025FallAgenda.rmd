Advantlis Working Group 2025-2027 funded by AG-Fisk grant
(274)-2024-Advantlis.

First workshop will be 1 September -- 5 September, 2025 in Woods Hole,
MA, USA.

ToRs (please add, edit as you see appropriate).

1.  Atlantis development. It would be helpful if we could push changes
    to CSIRO.

2.  Integrating thermal responses into Atlantis.

3.  Integrating Atlantis into the management process

4.  Atlantis and 30x30, how do we evaluate marine spatial planning, is
    Atlantis the correct tool? Are the polygons too large?

5.  Model skill. What is good enough? Can we build a framework to
    formalize model skill testing? (See Olsen, 2016)

6.  SE component linkage, external models via R vs internal module.

7.  Check how migratory species move. Do they go through other boxes or
    just disappear?

8.  Atlantis as an operating model

We will invite the economists to join us for Thursday and/or Friday.

Some people at MFRI who I would like to invite. Erla Sturludóttir, if
she can join for the whole time that would be great ash she is an
Atlantis modeler and developed the Iceland model. Bjarki Elvarrson,
who is the lead of the stock assessment team at MFRI and has very good
thoughts on Atlantis implementation. I will ask Bjarki to join for
discussion of ToRs 3 and 4. Julian Burgos, a benthic expert who is doing a 
lot of work on 30x30 (ToR 4). Pamela Woods, a fisheries biologist with expertise
in socioeconomic aspects (ToRs 3 and 6). If we keep ToR 8 then I would invite
William Butler who has done some work using Atlantis as an OM for Gadget.
